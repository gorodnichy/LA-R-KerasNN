'Learn and Apply Keras/Tensorflow in R/RStudio Efficiently'    
Using complete prewritten codes and your own data, With focus on analysis sequential and text data   

Based on:
- https://github.com/jjallaire/deep-learning-with-r-notebooks
- https://keras.rstudio.com (= https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/keras)
- https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-r
- everything else found useful on the Web, 
- and my own work back from 1995-2005 :)


Notes:
- Latest version of RStudio is always recommended (Presently, Version 1.1.447 â€“ 2018 )
- All codes are retrieved from original sources, simplified, merged and directly runnable from RStudio

- The order of lessons is recommended by indices: e.g. 1-1-1 goes prior to 1-3-1. [.] are optional.
- `# .... ####` comments are used for quick navigation from one example/section to another within RStudio IDE.
- `# >>> ... <<< ####` indicate Main sections
- Data to play with (traffic, favourite readings) are provided, inc. very small sets to run fast.
